The api in scope is for country India where vaccination drive is going on and availability of slots is very tough to get. The intention of making this was to help our developer community which is always busy in either terminal or their choice of code editor. So without leaving it we can get real time status of vaccine availability.

## Features

-> Ability to get vaccine availabilty data of a particular district in a particular state.
-> Ability to get vaccine data by applying age group filters eg.(18-45 or 45+).
